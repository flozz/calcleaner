best way to do it. This is of course not necessary if you just want to fix some
typo or small errors in the code.

Please note that your code must pass tests and follow the coding style defined
by the `pep8 <https://pep8.org/>`_. `Flake8
<https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`_ and `Black
<https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ are used on this project to enforce
coding style.
